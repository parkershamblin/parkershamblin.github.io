## Overview

Development of an intelligent game automation system using computer vision and machine learning to perform real-time object detection and automated interactions in Old School RuneScape.

## Key Features

- **Custom Cascade Classifier**: Trained a machine learning model using OpenCV's cascade training tools on 200+ positive cow images and 1000+ negative samples, achieving accurate object detection in game environments.
- **Real-Time Image Processing**: Implemented multi-threaded architecture to capture game screenshots, process them through the trained model, and perform automated mouse interactions simultaneously without blocking the main detection loop.
- **Automated Game Interaction**: Integrated PyAutoGUI for precise mouse movement and clicking, with intelligent target selection that calculates click points at the center of detected objects for optimal interaction accuracy.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in FPS tracking and loop timing to monitor real-time performance, ensuring the system maintains responsive detection rates during gameplay.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV**: For computer vision, image processing, and cascade classifier training and deployment.
- **Python**: Core programming language with threading support for concurrent operations.
- **PyAutoGUI**: For automated mouse control and game interaction.
- **NumPy**: For efficient array operations and image data manipulation.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was achieving reliable object detection in a dynamic game environment with varying lighting and background conditions. The solution involved collecting a diverse training dataset and fine-tuning cascade classifier parameters like hit rates and false alarm thresholds. Additionally, implementing proper threading to separate image processing from game interactions was crucial for maintaining real-time performance without detection lag.

## Outcome

The automation system successfully performs real-time cow detection and farming with consistent accuracy. The project demonstrates practical application of computer vision in gaming environments and showcases skills in machine learning model training, multi-threaded programming, and real-time image processing. The modular architecture allows for easy adaptation to detect other game objects by retraining the classifier model.
